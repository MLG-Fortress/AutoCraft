### About AutoCraft
AutoCraft was origionally created in 2011, but has undergone significant changes since then. AutoCraft was created by the MineSworn development team and has been passed down from author to author. This repository represents the true AutoCraft, but there are forks out there. If you would like to help contribute to AutoCraft, we do accept pull requests.
